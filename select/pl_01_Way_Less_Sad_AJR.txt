Hey-hey-hey hey-hey-hey
hey-hey-hey
Hey-hey-hey hey-hey-hey
hey-hey-hey
I should move ‘cause New York
is gettin' muddy out
There's L.A. but it's always
kinda sunny out
And I don't wanna hurt no more
So I set my bar real low
I'm a-okay I'm a-okay
You say it but you just
don't mean it
You're so insane
you're so insane
Shut up and just
enjoy this feelin'
Don't you love it
don't you love it
No I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad
Don't you love it
don't you love it
No I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad
Hеy-hey-hey hey-hеy-hey
hey-hey-hey
But I'm way less sad
Hey-hey-hey hey-hey-hey
hey-hey-hey
But I'm way less sad
I wake up and I'm not so mad
at Twitter now
Livin' sucks but it's suckin'
just a little now
And I don't wanna cry no more
So I set my bar real low
I'm a-okay I'm a-okay
You say it but you just
don't mean it
You're so insane
you're so insane
Shut up and just
enjoy this feelin'
Don't you love it
don't you love it
No I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad
Don't you love it
don't you love it
No I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad
I may be wrong
I may be wrong
It's stupid but it's all I have
Don't you love it
don't you love it
No I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad
Well I can't fall asleep
and I'm losin' my mind
'Cause it's half-past three
and my brain's on fire
I've been countin' sheep
but the sheep all died
And I'm tryin' too hard
but I can't not try
Well I can't fall asleep
and I'm losin' my mind
'Cause it's half-past three
and my brain's on fire
I've been countin' sheep
but the sheep all died
And I'm not dead yet
so I guess I'll be alright
Don't you love it
don't you love it
No I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad
Don't you love it
don't you love it
No I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad
I may be wrong (I may be wrong)
I may be wrong (I may be wrong)
It's stupid but it's all I have
Don't you love it
don't you love it
No I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad
